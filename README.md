## 1. Project Overview

This section provides a high-level summary of the project goals, scope, and key components.

### 1.1 Goals
* Allow users to create new accounts
* Allow users to submit applications and be considered as Writers.
* Allow users with writer roles to write, submit, and publish short stories called Tales.
* Allow users to write and submit articles - to address matters arising from Tales - called Insights.
* Allow users to write and submit short articles - sourced from news stories online and which may form foundations of new tales - called Watchlists.
* Allow users to engage with tales, insights, and watchlists through comments, flags, ratings, shares, and follows.
* Allow users to reply, rate, and flag comments
* Allow tagging of tales, insights, and watchlists to relate similar contents

### 1.2 Key Architectural Decisions
* IDE/Language/Framework: Visual Studio, C#, .NET
* Design Principles: Modular Monolith, Domain Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
* Validation: FluentValidation
* API Framework: FastEndpoints (implements REPR).
* Messaging: RabbitMQ. (MassTransit)
* RabbitMQ: Message broker
* PostGresSQL: Write & Read models
* Logging: Serlog
* Caching: Redis
* Documentation & Versioning: Swagger/OpenApi
* Search: ElasticSearch/OpenSearch
* Containerization: Docker
* Orchestration: Kubernetes
* Background Jobs/Scheduling: Hangfire
* Monitoring & Health: Prometheus & Grafana
* Unit testing: xUnit
* Mocking: Moq
* Intergration test: TestContainer
* Business requirement testing: SpecFlow
* Performance monitoring: OpenTelemetry
* API Gateway: Ocelot or Yarp
* Polly: Http calls and retries

* Database-Level Full Text Search //

### 1.3 Modules
* Onboarding : Concerned with user pre-registration
* Analysis : Concerned with Insights

## 3. Write Model: Onboarding

This section provides description of the onboarding work flows

### 3.1 Description
* Onboarding handles pre-registration for new users
* It verifies a user through a verification token
* After the pre-registration is completed, the onboarding entries are permanently deleted
** Note: Can/should email address be verified to be valid & active?

### 3.2 Models
* TempUser : AggregateRoot
** Id (Ulid)
** EmailAddress (string)
** CreatedAt (DateTime)
** LastUpdated (DateTime) : Monitors last time a token was resent or token verification attempt was made
** VerifiedAttempts (int) : Monitors number of verification attempts
** IpAddress (string)
** IsVerified (bool) : If true, token is verified
** LockUpdates (bool) : If true, no token resends or verifications
** LockUntil (DateTime) : Time until lockUpDates is lifted
** ResendsCounter (int) : Monitors token resends
** One-time-token : ValueObject
*** Token (int) : Generated
*** ExpiresAt (DateTime) : Date created + 10 minutes


### 3.3 Business rules
* There must be at least 60 seconds between resends of verification tokens
* There is a limit of 5 verification token resends within 10 minutes span
* There is a limit of 5 verification attempts within 10 minutes span
* Verification tokens cannot be sent to the same IpAddress within a 10 minutes span
* Life span of a verification token is 10 minutes


### 3.4 Commands Summary
* SendToken : Creates account, Sends generated token to user
* ResendToken : Regeneartes a token and sends to user
* VerifyToken : Verifies token on file


### 3.5 SendToken
* Creates a new temporary account, generates and returns a verification token

#### 3.5.1 Request
* EmailAddress (string): Email address from user
* IpAddress (string): From HttpRequest
